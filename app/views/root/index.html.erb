		<p>ZED9 is a new site for fitness analysis and comparison, making it easy to track and understand your own workouts and learn how to improve your performance.</p> 
		<p>We are working to do for fitness what <a href="http://www.mint.com" target="new">mint.com</a> does for finance. What does that mean? It means that ZED9 aggregates data from many sources to give you a single view and meaningful analytics for all your activities. It also means that you can share, compare, and contrast your performance with people in your community, demographics, and interest groups.</p> 
		<p>ZED9 offers cross-platform support for devices including:</p>
		<div id="supported_devices_list">
			<ul>
				<li>Garmin Forerunner 405</li>
				<li>Garmin Forerunner 305</li>
				<li>Polar RS400</li>
				<li>Polar RS800</li>
				<li>Suunto - <span class="coming_soon">coming soon</span></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<p>We are looking for fitness-oriented people to help alpha test and shape the future of ZED9. If you have an activity-logging device and would like to join us, add your name to the invite list.</p>
