Zed9 is your site for social fitness analytics.  Zed9 aggregates data from as many sources as possible, providing you with meaningful analytics on your workouts. Compare and contrast your performance with others in your network, demographics, and interest groups.  

Zed9 Alpha Release 0.1 Features:
 * Upload workouts from supported file types (see below for specific list)
 * See HR graph for uploaded workouts
 * See map of workout if GPS data included
 * Compare individual workouts to all your workouts and to zed9 wide statistics
 * Share your workout with other registered Zed9 users.
 * Merge workouts from multiple devices into one workout!
 * Site-wide leader board for each activity
 * Make sure to hover over your stats on a workout to see details!

Some caveats to be aware of:
 * You will likely need to re-upload any workouts at a later time as the DB evolves.
 * Uploading workouts with RR data (i.e. from a Polar RS800) is SLOW.  It can take up to 5 minutes.  This will be fixed in a future release.
 * Deleting activities can be slow.  This will be fixed in a future release.

Features planned for the next few weeks:
 * Faster processing of RR based workouts
 * Additional graphs included speed & altitude
 * Upload multiple files at once
 * Edit workouts inline
 * Track weight & VO2 over time
 * Calculate calories based on HR data
 * More advanced comparative analytics

Supported Devices:
I've tested this with the following devices.  If your device isn't listed, please get in touch so I can support it!
 * Polar RS400
 * Polar RS800
 * Garmin Forerunner 405
 * Garmin Forerunner 305

Where can I find my workouts to upload?
For garmin, please see this quick video ( less than 1 min ) http://vimeo.com/4279824
For Polar, it depends on the device.  you can often easily export them from ProTrainer by going to file->email

The more feedback I receive, the better this product will be.  If you have any specific features, bugs, or input on changes, please email me and let me know what you would like to see.  I will be contacting you in the next week to follow up on your experience so far, and see what I can do to make Zed9 better.

Thank you for helping alpha test Zed9.
