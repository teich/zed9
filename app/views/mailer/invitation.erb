By joining the ZED9 beta, you can:

     * Track all your workouts in one place, no matter what device(s) you use. You can even merge independent data from a heart rate monitor, GPS logger, etc. to get the full picture of any workout

     * See what's working (tons of data porn!): cool graphs and stats for every workout let you see how you measure up and help you (or a trainer) identify ways to improve your performance

     * Compare and compete with friends, groups, and the community, no matter where they are or what tracking device they use

     * Find new motivation to up your standing on the leader boards

     * Shape the future of ZED9 with your feedback

     * Access all of the analytics and features on ZED9 for free (for beta users).

To participate in the beta, you need access to the Internet and a fitness tracking device (like a heart rate monitor or GPS logger) that connects to a computer. ZED9 currently supports several models from Garmin, Polar, Suunto, and any .gpx format GPS logs. See the full list at http://zednine.com/devices.

Hope to see you soon on ZED9!
