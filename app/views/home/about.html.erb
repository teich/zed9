		<h4>ZED9 is a new site for fitness analysis and comparison.</h4>
		<p>We are working to do for fitness what <a href="http://www.mint.com" target="new">mint.com</a> does for finance. What does that mean? It means we aggregate the data from many fitness devices to make it easy to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>track and understand your own workouts</li>
				<li>see how you measure up against yourself and others</li>
				<li>learn how to improve your performance</li>
			</ul>

			<p>ZED9 is in alpha with many features to come. Everyone can view the workouts that members have made public, but membership is by invitation only while we scale up. Put your name on the list for an invitation, or <a href="contact">drop us a note</a> to let us know what device you're using or how we're measuring up!</p> 

		<p><h4>Who is behind ZED9?</h4></p>
		<p>We are Oren and Olivia Teich. We are product managers in Silicon Valley. Oren used to be a programmer; Olivia preferred history and art. Oren is a biker, runner, and P90Xer. Olivia loves hiking with the dog, tennis, yoga, classes at Equinox, and the occasional swim or run. We are casual athletes who sometimes need a little help motivating, so we are putting the best of what we have learned at big companies like Yahoo! and Sun and lots of great startups into ZED9.</p>
					
		<p><h4>The story of ZED9</h4></p>
		<p>We like variety in exercise, and we like to know how we're doing. We were frustrated that there wasn't a way to see how we were doing in our biking, hiking, running, tennis, swimming, weights, yoga, and classes. The Polar RS400 is great for heart rate and indoor activities, but doesn't collect GPS data. The Garmin 405 gets GPS but doesn't work inside. The Nike+ is great for challenging friends, but doesn't get heart rate or location.</p>
		<p>An excuse for more gadgets has never been a bad thing in our house, but understanding our activities across them was. Even figuring out how many times a week we had been working out took logging into three pieces of software, and none of them helped in analyzing our progress. And so we started building ZED9.</p>
