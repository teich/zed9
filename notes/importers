Data Importers
simply transforming into canonical format stored in DB.  
Take data stream as input, provide accessor functions in normalized manner

	
base object should have some basic accessors:
	trackpoints - I think I can use the 

constructor reads from file and creates data structure
	

Questions:
 * how does inheritance in ruby work?
 * is it worth having a datapoint be an object itself?  array of objects seems heavyweight
